# Overview

Linear Search is a method for finding an element withing a list by sequentially checking each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Linear Search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and data structures, such as the binary search and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.

Linear Search is best efficient when searching through only a few elements or an unsorted list.

# How does it work?

Given a certain target item that you are searching for and a list of elements, iterate through each element in the list and compare your target to the element. We complete the algorithm once we have found the target value on the list or we reach the end of the list.

# Runtimes

|                 | Worst Case | Average Case | Best Case |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Time Complexity | O(n)       | O(n)         | O(1)      |
