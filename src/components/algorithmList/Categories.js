		title: 'Data Structures',
		description: 'Data structures are used to store and manipulate different types of data. Each data structure is beneficial depending on what is needed from the data being stored. Data structures includes arrays, stacks, queues, trees, and linked lists.',

		title: 'Trees',
		description: 'Trees are a nonlinear data structure. Instead, they have a hierarchical structure. Trees are a useful data structure for fast read and writes of data. Some of the most known trees are binary trees, AVL trees, and 2-4 trees.',

		title: 'Backtracking',
		description: 'Backtracking is an algorithm which finds solutions to a specific problem. This is done by going through different possible solutions and marking which path led to a solution or not. One of the most used examples of backtracking is the nQueens problem.',

		title: 'Dynamic Programming',
		description: 'Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.',

		path: 'recursion',
		title: 'Recursion',
		description: 'Recusion is a technique used when creating algorithms, where the algorithm calls itself within the algorithm. Popular problems solved through this method include the Towers of Hanoi and the Fibonacci Sequence.',
